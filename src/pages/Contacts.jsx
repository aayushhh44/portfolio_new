          Before delving into the digital world, I pursued an academic path
          deeply rooted in understanding human behavior and cognition. I earned
          a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Psychology, followed by a Masterâ€™s degree in
          Cognitive Sciences, where I explored the intersection of the mind and
          technology. This foundation has profoundly influenced my approach to
          generative art and design, providing me with a unique perspective on
          creativity. It has also deepened my understanding of how artificial
          intelligence operates today.

          I began my journey as a web designer in 1999, finding creative
          fulfillment later with ActionScript, where I developed unique and
          interactive websites that pushed the boundaries of digital design.
