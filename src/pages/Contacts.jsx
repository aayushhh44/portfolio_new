            I studied taking biology as my major till grade 12th

          . I enjoyed studying biology and had dreams of becoming a doctor. This
          was also because my parents encouraged me, as I was a good student
          from the beginning.
          <br />
          Over time, I realized I was more interested in technology. I decided
          to switch to computer science, and started exploring new tools and
          technologies to create new things. I now enjoy learning about web
          development, blockchain, and other technologies. My journey has
          changed, but my passion for learning and creating will continue.

        <p className="my-6 font-poppins">
          Back in 9th and 10th grade, I hadn’t explored anything in tech. Most
          of my time was spent playing video games and outdoor games. My routine
          was simple:{" "}
          <span className="font-bold">
            going to school, studying, and coming back home

        <p className="my-6 font-poppins">
          During the lockdown, I spent most of my time playing video games while
          attending online classes. Haha, it wasn’t just me, we whole classmates
          used to do that. I did read some medical books, but I wasn’t really
          focused on programming. Looking back, the things I regret not doing
          during that time are not learning how to play the guitar and
          programming.

          After the lockdown, I attended various seminars and events, where I
          had the chance to network with different people. It was also when I
          started learning programming, beginning with C and Java, and gradually
          moving into web development.
